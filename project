## Football and Data Analytics

#### Introduction to the theme 
#In this project I will explore the influence of data analytics. It has grown in every area of our lives over the last two decades: in companies of all kinds, 
#but also in sports. Football was supposed to be resilient to this pattern until a few years ago. Early adopters in the major football leagues are already 
#booming as a result of the strategic edge that data mining investments is providing. Liverpool, AZ Alkmaar, and Brentford are only a handful of the many promising
#case studies. Clubs who do not plan to get on the analytics train, will be left behind.

#### What is the business problem I will be addressing?
#The main business problem I am looking forward to solving is whether supported by data (i.e statistics of a football match) the club can both obtain the desirable
#position it aims and as a result improve its financial health. The higher you are ranked in your respective league the higher the probability of accessing the
#millionaire leagues like Champions and Europa league and thus improve your financials. 

#In order to solve this problem, I will use the Football Data: Expected Goals and Other Metrics from Kaggle 
#(https://www.kaggle.com/slehkyi/extended-football-stats-for-european-leagues-xg). This data set contains statistical summary data by the end of each season from
#2014 to 2019 for 6 UEFA Leagues (La Liga, EPL, 

## Storytelling
#I was hired by Arsenal to better understand which statistics led to the championship and consequently improve the financial health of the club. Having done that I 
#used a database called understat.com.csv to do the visualization of the impact of the statistics.  To develop my workproject for Arsenal I did some data exploration,
#curation and cleaning so then I could show the most important plots. Then they could grasp easily the concepts I wanted to pass on to them. As we are all aware of 
#by visualizing our conclusions it is way easier for the receiver(Arsenal staff) to percept the data more easily.

## Arsenal performance over the years and the need of analytics to improve its results
#I performed this first graph to demonstrate to the club that historically they have been declining and for instance in 2015 they managed to get the second place
#and when comparing to 2019 they finished that championship in 8th place which for a club of this dimension is not acceptable. This was also another factor that 
#led this english club to seek out for new solutions like data analysis in football performed by me.

#After visualizing the correlation graph it was quite perceptible that there were some variables which were higly correlated. Correlation shows the strength of a
#relationship between two variables and is expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient's values range between 0 and 1.0. 
#A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. I will now give an example to clarify what I meant: the expected points(xpts)
#is extremely correlated with the offensive possession(deep) meaning that generally teams which have more offensive possession end up winning games. By having this
#information transmitted to Arsenal now the team can develop a strategy where it preferes more offensive approaches than counterattack approaches for instance.

## Best offensive teams usually achieve higher positions
#This representation is here to reflect the importance of being able to transform offensive opportunitie into goals. Basically the teams with higher effictiveness 
#in scoring goals will be able to win more games and therefore be in the top positions. By knowing this offensive training with the players is of utter importance 
#having into account the objective of Arsenal which is to dominate the EPL

#So in the graphics on the left it is visble that Liverpool does not concede as much goals as Arsenal and so one main focus should be draft exercises to
#foment a better defense. The middle graphs reflects the difference of number of goals scored that Liverpool surpasses by a margin of 10 goals Arsenal! 
#Lastly the graphics on the right side shows that Liverpool is better defensively and so Arsenal need to be more agressive when defending.

## Cross leagues comparison
#Lastly as Arsenal usually enters in the European competitions either the Champions League or the Europe League it was also important to understand how the
#different leagues differ from the EPL. I also used different colours in the graphs so as to know for instance that all the Bundesliga bars are all blue and
#so it is easier to use a color system to distinguish the different leagues.

#In this four plots there are some variables compared and just to give an example if Arsenal is playing against Real Madrid which is from La Liga it will need to 
#outline a paln to stop the offensive avalanche from this team as in this league the teams score a lot of goals.

## Conclusions/Recommendations
#1) If Arsenal wants to be a top team again it should focus on the most correlated metrics with wins and points. As a result the most important ones are the goals 
#scored and goals against as well as offensive possession that usually translates into more goals
#2) By improving some of the metics here mentioned Arsenal will manage to get more points and thus get direct entry to the international competitions and improve 
#the results financially speaking.
#3) I have some limnitations regarding our dataset because I do not know if to increase this metrics it is required investement in new players and that could 
#cancel off the effect of achieving the positions of going to Champions League and therefore do not improve the financial health of the club
